I am a current junior computer science and music double major at Hendrix College in Conway, AR. This blog is created in conjunction with CSCI 340: Databases and Web Systems, which I am currently taking (Fall '23).

In comp sci world, I'm not really sure what I want to do yet! My inspiration for undergoing the computer science major was originally video game production, which I'll be taking a class on in Spring '25. However, I'm not entirely sure this is the field of comp sci that I'll go into once I graduate. I'm excited to see where the world takes me!

In music world, I am currently in my tenth year of playing percussion (a whole decade! Wow!) If I had to pick a favorite instrument, it would probably be timpani. I'm also a huge fan of battery (fun fact: I marched tenors in my high school's marching band!) I like mallet when I only have to hold two because my hands do *not* like four mallet grip. 

Outside of my majors, I'm also an avid writer! I dabble in a bit of everything: poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and even playwriting! While I don't want to be an author for a living, it's a goal of mine to have a piece published one day!

A few other miscellaneous fun facts: I collect lots of things! Namely Pokemon cards, playing card decks, enamel pins, and stuffed animals! I can lick my elbow (right and left!), I aspire to be a cat dad one day, and I thoroughly believe that milk is a good-tasting beverage.
