### Introduction
The sun conure (or, *Aratinga solstitialis*) is also known as the sun parakeet. It is a parrot native to northeastern South America.
Its conservation status is currently **Endangered**; they are currently threatened by loss of habitat and trapping for plumage and the pet trade.

### Description
Sun conures weigh, on average, around 110 grams, or 4 ounces. They are around 30 centimeters, or 12 inches, tall. <br>
Adult sun conures have similar appearances across sexes; they have black beaks, golden-yellow plumage, orange underparts and face, and green- and blue-tipped wings and tails. Juvenile sun conures have green plumage; the yellow, orange, and reddish coloration is attained with maturity. <br>

### Habitat
Sun conures live in a relatively small region of northeastern South America, including:
1. Roraima
2. Southern Guyana
3. Southern Suriname
4. Southern French Guiana <br>
They also occur as vagrants to coastal French Guiana. Their status in Venezuela is unclear, but recent sightings from the southeast near Santa Elena de Uairen have been reported. Populations previously found along the Amazon River are now known to belong to the sulphur-breasted parakeet, which it is easily confused with due to physical similarities and close relation. <br>
Sun conures are mostly found in tropical habitats, but their exact ecological requirements remain relatively poorly known. <br>

### Behavior
Sun conures are very social, and they typically occur in flocks of 15-30 individuals. They rarely leave their flock, but if they get separated, they squawk and scream in a high-pitched voice that can carry for hundreds of yards, allowing individuals to communicate with their flock and return to them. Flocks are relatively quiet when feeding, but are known to be incredibly vocal. <br>
Nonverbal communication is also practiced through a variety of physical displays, such as feeding and preening one another. <br>
Sun conures can travel many miles in a day and are fast, direct fliers. <br>
Sun conures move through trees using their beaks for extra support. They can also use their feet like hands to hold, examine, or eat items. <br>
When in molt, sun conures are uncomfortable and easily irritable. Bathing, warm rainfalls, and humidity allow the sheaths of each pin feather to open more easily, which eases their discomfort. <br>
Sun conures are incredibly smart and curious, and therefore require constant mental stimulation and social interaction. Their speech and ability to learn tricks in captivity are quite moderate. <br>

### Diet
Sun conures mainly feed on fruits, flowers, berries, blossoms, seeds, nuts, and insects. Sometimes, they forage from agricultural crops, and may be considered a pest. They require more protein intake during breeding season, more carbohydrates when rearing young, and more calcium during egg production.
